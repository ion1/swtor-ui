# [Star Wars: The Old Republic][swtor] user interface layout generator

[swtor]: http://www.swtor.com/

Describe how SWTOR UI elements are anchored to the screen and each other
programmatically and generate a UI profile as an alternative to moving each
element to the desired position manually in the SWTOR UI editor.

As an example, the following UI layout was generated by [`app/Main.hs`](app/Main.hs). The layout file is available in [`generated/ion.xml`](generated/ion.xml?raw=true).
