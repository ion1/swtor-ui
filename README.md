# [Star Wars: The Old Republic][swtor] user interface layout generator

[swtor]: http://www.swtor.com/

Specify how SWTOR UI elements are anchored to the screen and to each other and
generate a UI profile to be loaded by the game. This is an alternative to the
in-game interface editor which does not have any functionality to align
elements with each other or move them as a group.

As an example, the following UI layout was generated by [`app/Main.hs`](app/Main.hs). The layout file is available in [`generated/ion.xml`](generated/ion.xml?raw=true).
